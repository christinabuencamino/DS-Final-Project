**Abstract**: My final project aims to discover if there is a correlation between the median income of a zip code and how many (if any) farmer's markets station in said zip code. I used an OpenData CSV breakdown of NYC farmer's markets present in 2019, along with census data that shows the 2019 median income (in dollars) of zip codes in NYC.<br>

## Initial Hypothesis
My initial hypothesis was that farmer's markets target higher income neighborhoods. My reasoning for this was mainly from personal experience, since the markets I have been to in NYC have had some pretty steep prices.
<br>
## Mapping The Data
To begin, I created a map of all of the farmer's markets in NYC using the <a href url="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/DOHMH-Farmers-Markets/8vwk-6iz2/data">DOHMH Farmers Markets Open Data set</a>.
