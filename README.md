Abstract: My final project aims to discover if there is a correlation between the median income of a zip code and how many (if any) farmer's markets station in said zip code. I used an OpenData CSV breakdown of NYC farmer's markets present in 2019, along with census data that shows the 2019 median income (in dollars) of zip codes in NYC.<br>
Relevance: While farmer's markets aren't unique or vital to New York City, they can serve as a means of discussing access to fresh food and the resources available to someone depending on their area. If these markets generally target a specific income bracket, there are many implications that can arise, depending on if they target a specific income bracket or not.<br>
